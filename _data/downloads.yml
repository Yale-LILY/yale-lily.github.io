    - title: AAN previous version # <a href="http://clair.eecs.umich.edu/aan">AAN (previous version)</a>
      description: The AAN corpus includes three networks, paper citation, author citation and author collaboration.  The paper citation network (paper-citation-network.txt) is a directed network composed of nodes labeled with paper ids which correspond to individual papers (acl-metadata.txt).  The author citation network (author-citation-network.txt), a directed network, is compiled from the paper network and the metadata file.  For each citation in the paper network, where paper A cites paper B, and for each author in paper A, an edge is created for that author to each author in paper B.  The author collaboration network (author-collaboration-network.txt), an undirected network, is composed of authors where, for each paper in the paper citation network, an edge is created between each collaborator for that paper.
