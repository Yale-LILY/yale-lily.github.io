    <h2 class="post-title">Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR)</h2>
  </header> 

We collaborate with researchers from Columbia University, the University of Maryland, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of Cambridge to build search engines for English users to query documents written in other languages including Swahili and Tagalog. This cross-lingual information retrieval system improves our capability of understanding and processing different low-resource languages and it offers users a reliable access to foreign documents.
