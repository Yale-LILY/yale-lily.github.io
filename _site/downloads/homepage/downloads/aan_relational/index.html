	   This classification dataset contains 380 scientific publications from <a href="../../../clair/anthology">AAN</a> manually classified into three research areas ("Machine Translation", "Dependency Parsing" and "Summarization").  This is a relational dataset since we have included metadata information
	   for the papers which includes citation information, authorship information, venue information and year of publication.
	   <br/>
	   Here is a description of the files included.
	   <PRE class="normal">
	aan_mds 
	| 
	|-----metadata.txt    Contains the id, title, authorship, venue and the class information for all the papers.  
	| 
	|-----papers_text     This directory contains the full text of the 380 papers. We obtained this text by converting 
	|		      the PDF of the paper to text using PDFBox.  
	|
	|-----citations.txt   The file contains citations between ALL the papers in the AAN data set not just the citations 
			      between the 380 papers in the dataset. This is because many link/citation similarity 
			      measures like cocitation or coupling compute similarity between two papers using citations
			      between other papers.
