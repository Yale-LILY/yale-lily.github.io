The Israeli government says it's expecting the Palestinian authority to
formally outlaw the military wings of the Islamic Jihad and the militant
group Hamas.
That's in response to Friday's suicide bombing in Jerusalem.

 Reporter:  
Jerusalem police dogs sniff for bombs -- part of heightened
security after the radical Islamic Jihad group which took responsibility
for Friday's market attack threatened to repeat their attempt to kill
israelis and scuttle the new land-for-security accord.
The Israeli cabinet, which suspended consideration of the wye agreement the
moment it learnt of the market explosions, pointedly didn't meet for its
usual weekly session.
But defense minister yitzhak mordechai, among the agreement's most earnest
supporters, said on Sunday the government will reconvene later in the week
to approve the accord.
In the wake of the market attack, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian police say
they've arrested several dozen members of Islamic Jihad.
The mood at this headquarters of the Palestinian security apparatus is
relaxed.
It's hoped a top-flight meeting of Palestinian and Israeli security chiefs
which was held to coordinate the ongoing efforts to curb the militants will
smooth the way towards putting the wye process fully back on track.
A concern of the Palestinian security chiefs -- that more terror attacks
could derail Yasser Arafat's objective to win back more land as committed
by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at wye.

Listen, satisfying Netanyahu is not my objective.
We have a national interest to stop using violence and armed struggle and
terror in order to achieve national aspirations or national targets.

The Israeli prime minister, while pushing for the stepped-up
joint security effort, is also talking tough, especially to his right-wing
followers.
He declared everything was conditional.
If you fight, you get.
If you don't fight, you don't get, he said.
At another University, a reminder there are plenty of forces planning to
undercut the agreement along with the Israeli flag, the students burned a
Model of a Jewish settlement.
We must remember, this speaker tells the rally, our history is written not
in ink, but in blood.
