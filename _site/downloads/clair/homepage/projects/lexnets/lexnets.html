<h1>Lexical networks (Lexnets)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Recently, there has been a lot of interest in looking at language from
a network or graph-based perspective.  Networks are a natural
representation for many linguistic structures and almost all levels of
language have been examined using graph-based methods.  Network
representations have been used for tasks such as document
summarization, word sense disambiguation, and information retrieval.
</p>

<p>
Using graph-based methods, we look at latent semantic structure in
lexical networks.  Lexical networks are generated from collections of
documents, with edges in the network corresponding the the similarity
between the two documents.  The standard cosine similarity measure is
used.  A collection of networks can be generated by varying the cosine
value, and this collection of networks is called a latent network or
semantic similarity network.
</p>

<p>
We look at cosine distributions and network structure across different
collections of documents.  In particular, the network structure of
semantically cohesive collections is compared to semantically diverse
collections.  We also examine the predicted cosine distribution of
documents of varying lengths and vocabulary sizes based on a Zipfian
language model.
</p>

<p>
For comparison, we also examine the growth of several non-lexical
networks.

<h2>Applications</h2>

Network models may provide new insight into the semantic content of
large text collections.  For example, semantic similarity networks may
be used to identify shifts in topics and identify fake or forged
articles.  In addition, semantic similarity networks can be used for
traditional information retrieval tasks such as document clustering.
