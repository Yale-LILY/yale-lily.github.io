The Human Components of Machine Learning

<a class="btn btn-labeled btn-primary" href="#test3" data-toggle="collapse"> Abstract </a>  
<div style="max-width:400px" id="test3" class="collapse">
Machine learning is often viewed as an automated process. Data is fed to a learning algorithm that outputs a trained model which then makes predictions. In practice, however it is common for every step of this process to rely on humans in the loop. Training data is often generated through human activity, either as passive observations of social processesor actively crowdsourced annotations. Humans prepare this data for use by the algorithm, engineer features, and tweak the algorithm’s parameters to fit their needs. And in many applications to medicine, criminal justice, and other critical domains, humans must interpret the learned model’s predictions to determine how to best make use of these predictions in their own decision making process. In this talk, I’ll argue for the importance of understanding the humans in the loop. As one example, I’ll describe some of my own research on crowdsourcing aimed at understanding who the crowd is, what motivates them, and how they communicate. I’ll also touch on a new direction of research that I’m particularly excited about, studying how to make machine learning human-interpretable, and what human interpretability even means.

Social Event Extraction: Inferring International Relations and Police Killings from the News

<a class="btn btn-labeled btn-primary" href="#test7" data-toggle="collapse"> Abstract </a>  
<div style="max-width:400px" id="test7" class="collapse">
What can text analysis tell us about society? Enormous corpora of news, social media, and historical documents record events, beliefs, and culture. Automated text analysis scales to large data sets, and can assist in discovering patterns and themes. I will discuss projects to extract event databases from the news, in the domains of international relations and police killings in the U.S. First, we analyze the raw text of 15 years of news articles to extract temporal trends of diplomacy, conflict, and military actions between pairs of countries, including, for example, the recent history of Israeli-Palestinian relations. Our model combines syntactic parsing and latent-variable probabilistic modeling to induce event classes, and we validate against predefined ontologies and databases of interstate conflict. Second, we tackle the surprising lack of systematic records on police killings of civilians in the U.S., by helping automate the extraction of these fatality events from news articles, in order to assist manual curation efforts. Our methods make use of distant supervision and outperform extractors used in previous NLP research. In addition to using natural language processing to advance social understanding, findings from the social sciences can better inform the design of artificial intelligence. Given time and interest, I will briefly overview our efforts to identify and fix dialectal and racial disparity in language technologies.

In this talk I present results of work that uses computational phylogenetics to infer the dates and trajectories of spread of the Pama-Nyungan family of Australian languages. I show how evolutionary approaches to language change allow us to model language spread and gain insights into both specific language histories and patterns of change more generally.

Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data: Method and Application to Congressional Speech

Jesse Shapiro</a><br /> 

Brown University <br /> 



<a class="btn btn-labeled btn-primary" href="#test1" data-toggle="collapse"> Abstract </a>  
<div style="max-width:400px" id="test1" class="collapse">
We study trends in the partisanship of congressional speech from 1873 to 2016. We define partisanship to be the ease with which an observer could infer a congressperson’s party from a fixed amount of speech, and we estimate it using a structural choice model and methods from machine learning. Our method corrects a severe finite-sample bias that we show arises with standard estimators. The results reveal that partisanship is far greater in recent years than in the past, and that it increased sharply in the early 1990s after remaining low and relatively constant over the preceding century. Our method is applicable to the study of high-dimensional choices in many domains, and we illustrate its broader utility with an application to residential segregation.

Probabilistic Typology: Deep Generative Models of Vowel Inventories

<a class="btn btn-labeled btn-primary" href="#test5" data-toggle="collapse"> Abstract </a>  
<div style="max-width:400px" id="test5" class="collapse">
Linguistic typology studies the range of structures present in human language. The main goal of the field is to discover which sets of possible phenomena are universal, and which are merely frequent. For example, all languages have vowels, while most—but not all—languages have an [u] sound. In this paper we present the first probabilistic treatment of a basic question in phonological typology: What makes a natural vowel inventory? We introduce a series of deep stochastic point processes, and contrast them with previous computational, simulation-based approaches. We provide a comprehensive suite of experiments on over 200 distinct languages.

In the last decade, there has been a slowly growing interaction between robotics researchers and clinicians to look at the viability of using robots as a tool for enhancing therapeutic and diagnostic options forindividuals with autism spectrum disorder. While much of the early work in using robots for autism therapy lacked clinical rigor, new research is beginning to demonstrate that robots improve engagement and elicit novel social behaviors from people (particularly children and teenagers) with autism.  However, why robots in particular show this capability, when similar interactions with other technology or with adults or peers fails to show this response, remains unknown.  This talk will present some of the most recent evidence showing robots eliciting social behavior from individuals with autism and discuss some of the mechanisms by which these effects may be generated. As a diagnostic tool, robots offer a social press that is repeatable and controllable to allow for standardization of interactive stimuli across individuals and across time. Because robots can provide consistent, reliable actions, clinicians can ensure that identical stimuli are presented at each diagnostic session. Furthermore, the component systems in socially aware robots may offer non-interactive methods for tracking human-human social behaviors. The perceptual systems of these robots are designed to measure and quantify social behavior—that is, exactly the skills that must be identified during diagnosis.

Brian Scassellati is a Professor of Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Mechanical Engineering at Yale University and Director of the NSF Expedition on Socially Assistive Robotics. His research focuses on building embodied computational models of human social behavior, especially the developmental progression of early social skills. Using computational modeling and socially interactive robots, his research evaluates models of how infants acquire social skills and assists in the diagnosis and quantification of disorders of social development (such as autism). His other interests include humanoid robots, human-robot interaction, artificial intelligence, machine perception, and social learning. Dr. Scassellati received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001. His dissertation work (Foundations for a Theory of Mind for a Humanoid Robot) with Rodney Brooks used models drawn from developmental psychology to build a primitive system for allowing robots to understand people. His work at MIT focused mainly on two well-known humanoid robots named Cog and Kismet. He also holds a Master of Engineering in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (1995), and Bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (1995) and Brain and Cognitive Science (1995), all from MIT. Dr. Scassellati's research in social robotics and assistive robotics has been recognized within the robotics community, the cognitive science community, and the broader scientific community. He was named an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow in 2007 and received an NSF CAREER award in 2003. His work has been awarded five best-paper awards. He was the chairman of the IEEE Autonomous Mental Development Technical Committee from 2006 to 2007, the program chair of the IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL) in both 2007 and 2008, and the program chair for the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in 2009.

<div style="max-width:400px" id="test11" class="collapse">
Crowdsourcing has been widely used for fairly accurate information gathering, and digital technologies enlarge the scope. We examine how herding in crowdsourcing can arise based on how much information is made available to participants in such a cros setting. Using a randomized experiment with an aggregator of crowdsourced financial information, we investigate the causal impact of differential informational environments on overall quality and quantity of information. We find significant user heterogeneity i n how they respond to different designs, and evaluate strategies for how the value of crowdsourcing can be improved.

<div style="max-width:400px" id="test100" class="collapse">
Australian Aboriginal societies have a diverse and complex cultural heritage expressed, in particular, through differences in ritual, myth, song and art. This variation can be analyzed using phylogenetic tree-modeling methods that may help us answer such questions as: 1. Can changes in ritual complexity be explained by variation in other elements of Australian social life, and 2. Can some cultural elements, such as rock art motifs,  be used as 'population markers' to trace historic movements of people within Australia. Preliminary analyses associated with answering both these questions will be presented at the workshop.
