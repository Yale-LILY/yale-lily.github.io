      <S SNO='5' PAR='5' RSNT='1'>Dozens of people in the Pirelli building were injured after several floors of the 32-story building caught fire, local reports said.</S>

      <S SNO='7' PAR='7' RSNT='1'>Only the pilot was on board the plane, reported The Associated Press.</S>
      <S SNO='8' PAR='8' RSNT='1'>The weather was clear at the time of the crash.</S>
      <S SNO='9' PAR='9' RSNT='1'>The crash happened during rush hour, as office workers were ending their day, so few people were in the building when it happened.</S>
      <S SNO='10' PAR='10' RSNT='1'>The building has since been cleared, and the fire is now under control, reported ABCNEWS' Rome bureau.</S>
      <S SNO='11' PAR='11' RSNT='1'>It damaged the 23rd through the 29th floors, which were being restored and weren't occupied at the time, local reports said.</S>
      <S SNO='12' PAR='12' RSNT='1'>A man who was on the 21st floor at the time the plane hit said the building was evacuated in an orderly fashion.</S>

      <S SNO='14' PAR='14' RSNT='1'>A small tourist plane crashed into the tallest building in Milan.</S>
      <S SNO='15' PAR='15' RSNT='1'>(ABCNEWS.com/Magellan Geographix) The plane was destined for Italy's capital Rome, and departed from Lucerne airport in Switzerland, sources from the National Air Safety board told ANSA.</S>
      <S SNO='16' PAR='16' RSNT='1'>It was the second time since the Sept. 11 terror attacks that a plane has struck a high-rise building, and the crash raised fears of another attack.</S>
      <S SNO='17' PAR='17' RSNT='1'>But local officials now say it was probably an accident.</S>
      <S SNO='18' PAR='18' RSNT='1'>A transport official told Reuters the plane had reported problems with its undercarriage and was circling the city ahead of trying to land at a local airport.</S>

      <S SNO='20' PAR='20' RSNT='1'>Italian TV said the pilot's SOS involved a technical problem.</S>
      <S SNO='21' PAR='21' RSNT='1'>Police say the plane was an Air Commando   8212; a small plane similar to a Piper.</S>
      <S SNO='22' PAR='22' RSNT='1'>Initial reports described the plane as a Piper, but did not note the specific model.</S>
      <S SNO='23' PAR='23' RSNT='1'>According to ABCNEWS aviation expert John Nance, Piper planes have no history of mechanical troubles or other problems that would lead a pilot to lose control.</S>
      <S SNO='24' PAR='24' RSNT='1'>'Those aircraft have direct mechanical controls," says Nance.</S>
      <S SNO='25' PAR='25' RSNT='1'>"If you have a control problem, it would be the loss of an engine, and those are either controllable or not."</S>
      <S SNO='26' PAR='26' RSNT='1'>U.S. officials told ABCNEWS they had no indication the crash was a terrorist attack.</S>
      <S SNO='27' PAR='27' RSNT='1'>Neither American nor Italian forces were on heightened alert, they said.</S>
      <S SNO='28' PAR='28' RSNT='1'>The FBI has offered help in the crash investigation, but it remains to be seen if Italy will accept.</S>

      <S SNO='30' PAR='30' RSNT='1'>I have no additional information at all for you at this time.</S>
      <S SNO='31' PAR='31' RSNT='1'>This is a breaking story and we don't have anything else beyond that   8212; the president has been informed."</S>
      <S SNO='32' PAR='32' RSNT='1'>"I think you can presume that we will be   8212; if we are not already   8212; in touch with Italian authorities and will ascertain precisely what the facts are," he said.</S>
      <S SNO='33' PAR='33' RSNT='1'>Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was on his way back to Italy from Bulgaria, and a crisis center is being set up.</S>
      <S SNO='34' PAR='34' RSNT='1'>Airspace at the local Linate airport was reportedly cleared, but Milan's Malpensa international airport, further away from the city center, was not affected.</S>
      <S SNO='35' PAR='35' RSNT='1'>On Jan. 5, a 15-year-old boy crashed a stolen plane into a building in Tampa, Fla.</S>
      <S SNO='36' PAR='36' RSNT='1'>He was the only casualty.</S>
      <S SNO='37' PAR='37' RSNT='1'>ABCNEWS' Rome bureau and John McWethy at the Pentagon contributed to this report.</S>
      <S SNO='38' PAR='38' RSNT='1'>April 18   The Pirelli building, struck today by a small airplane, is Milan's tallest building, and is one of the world's highest concrete skyscrapers.</S>
      <S SNO='39' PAR='39' RSNT='1'>Built in the late 1950s, the office building stands 32 stories tall, or about 417 feet, according to the Web site, SkyScraperPage.com.</S>
      <S SNO='40' PAR='40' RSNT='1'>Other sources say the building is 30 stories tall.</S>
      <S SNO='41' PAR='41' RSNT='1'>By comparison, Paris' Eiffel Tower is about twice as tall, and New York's Empire State Building is 102 stories, or 1,455 feet tall.</S>
      <S SNO='42' PAR='42' RSNT='1'>Nevertheless, with its location near the city's central train station and its height relative to the buildings around it, the Pirelli building is considered a landmark and symbol of the commercial city of Milan.</S>
      <S SNO='43' PAR='43' RSNT='1'>The building was designed by the architect Gio Ponti, along with one of Italy's most important 20th-century structural engineers, Pier Luigi Nervi (1891-1979), known for his use of reinforced concrete.</S>
      <S SNO='44' PAR='44' RSNT='1'>Pirelli, the tire and cable company, does not operate out of the Pirelli building.</S>
      <S SNO='45' PAR='45' RSNT='1'>However, the office building houses the government administration of the Lombardy region of Italy.</S>
