Mine owners agree to clear up toxic sludge in Spain
</HEADLINE>

[1]	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ The owners of the mine where a toxic spill
devastated the environment agreed Friday to pay for the cleanup of
thousands of acres covered in contaminated sludge.
[2]	   The agreement was reached during a meeting between
representatives of Boliden Ltd., the Canadian-Swedish company that
owns the mine, and regional officials in the southern city of
Seville.
[3]	   An estimated 1.3 billion gallons (4.9 billion liters) of toxic
waste spewed into the Guadiamar River after a reservoir at the
Aznalcollar mine broke its banks Saturday. 
[4]        The river runs adjacent to Donana National Park, one of
Europe's most prized nature reserves, where millions of migratory
birds flock each year and lynx, otters, eagles and other endangered
wildlife live. 
[5]	   Boliden president Anders Bulow has said it would be up to the
courts to determine who was at fault and that the cause of the
reservoir break was apparently an underground shift of earth.
[6]	   A delegate for the regional Andalucian government, Jose Antonio
Viera, said that although Boliden would pay for the cleanup,
officials had no idea how long it would take or how much it would
cost.
[7]	   Volunteers wearing masks to protect against the toxic mud
continued Friday to clear away hundreds of dead fish and shell
fish. 
[8]        As much as 12 tons of fish has been removed in an effort to
prevent birds from being poisoned by eating the contaminated
creatures.
[9]	   Hastily built dikes helped divert the toxic liquid away
from the Donana reserve and save its marshland and forest from the
brunt of the contamination.
[10]	   But ecology groups, such as Greenpeace, say the massive
contamination of the surrounding area is certain to seep into the
park through the water supply or the movement of animals.
[11]	   One of Europe's biggest and most varied natural wildlife zones,
the park spans 185,000 acres (75,000 hectares) along a strip of
Spain's southwestern coast.
[12]	   The spill also has contaminated an estimated 10,000 acres (4,000
hectares) of agricultural land.
[13]	   Agriculture Minister Loyola de Palacio estimated the loss at
dlrs 10 million. 
[14]       But farmer groups maintained earlier this week that they
have suffered dlrs 79 million in crop losses. 
[15]	   News reports said Boliden was discussing compensation payments
for farmers and others.
